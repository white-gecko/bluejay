  keepassxc-librewolf:
    desc: Fix KeepassXC to work with LibreWolf
    summary: |
      Fix KeepassXC to work with Firefox/LibreWolf if both run in a flatpak. Following the instructions of:
      https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-run-firefox-and-keepassxc-in-a-flatpak-and-get-the-keepassxc-browser-add-on-to-work/437
      - Configure to start the keepassxc proxy
      - Allow access for the fox to the socket
      - Expose the socket
      The last two steps don't appear to be required in the current setup to work.
